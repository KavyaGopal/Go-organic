# Status Update for Sprint 2
We are developing organic food products web application to place the orders of the organic foods. We are using the tech stack Angular 13 for frontend, Golang 1.17 for the backend and SQLite for database. For sprint 1, we have completed the home page with
high level order of the categories to navigate and developed the mock APIs to get the desired products according to the category of the organic food.
